NPS vs UPS Pension Calculator - Default Constants Module

This module defines all configuration constants, default values, and system
parameters used throughout the pension calculator application. It serves as
a central configuration file that can be easily modified to adjust system
behavior without changing core logic.

Key Categories:
- Pay Structure: Pay levels, CPC years, fitment factors
- Service Options: Available services, investment strategies
- Financial Defaults: Inflation rates, interest rates, tapering periods
- System Limits: Date ranges, amount limits, validation bounds
- File Paths: Data directory, CSV file names

CONSTANT USAGE GUIDE:

1. PAY_LEVELS: Used in UI dropdowns and validation
   - Levels 1-9: Lower administrative positions
   - Level 10: Starting level for AIS officers
   - Levels 11-18: Higher administrative positions
   - Level 13A: Special level (skipped by IAS officers)

2. INVESTMENT_OPTIONS: Defines available investment strategies
   - Standard/Benchmark: Conservative 15% equity allocation
   - Auto_LC25: Lifecycle with 25% max equity (aggressive to conservative)
   - Auto_LC50: Lifecycle with 50% max equity (moderate to conservative) - DEFAULT
   - Auto_LC75: Lifecycle with 75% max equity (very aggressive to conservative)
   - Active: Manual allocation with age-based adjustments

3. PAY_COMMISSION_YEARS: Triggers major salary revisions
   - Each year triggers DA reset to 0
   - Fitment factors are applied to basic pay
   - New pay matrices are generated or loaded

4. FINANCIAL RATES: Drive investment returns and inflation
   - E (Equity): Higher returns, higher risk, tapers from 12% to 6%
   - C (Corporate Bonds): Medium returns, medium risk, tapers from 8% to 4%
   - G (Government Bonds): Lower returns, lower risk, stays at 4%

5. TIME PERIODS: Affect calculation granularity
   - Taper period: How quickly rates change (40 years = gradual change)
   - Pension duration: How long to project post-retirement (40 years)

6. WITHDRAWAL AND GRATUITY: Retirement benefit limits
   - Withdrawal: How much corpus can be taken as lumpsum
   - Gratuity: Government-capped retirement benefit

MODIFICATION GUIDELINES:

- PAY_LEVELS: Add new levels if CPC introduces them
- PAY_COMMISSION_YEARS: Update based on government announcements
- FINANCIAL_RATES: Adjust based on market expectations and policy changes
- TIME_PERIODS: Modify based on retirement age changes or planning horizons
- FILE_PATHS: Update if data directory structure changes

VALIDATION RULES:

- All rates must be positive numbers
- Final rates should generally be lower than initial rates (tapering down)
- Pay commission years should be in ascending order
- Fitment factors should typically be >= 1.0
- Time periods should be reasonable (10-100 years)
